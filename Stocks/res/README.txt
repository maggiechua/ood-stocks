Stocks Program (Part 1)

by: Aarushi Shankar and Maggie Chua
***********************************

This program allows a user to input a stock and check the following information about the stock:
    - the gain-loss average of the entered stock based on a specific date range
    - the x-day moving-average of the stock based on a specific date and x-input
    - if a specific date is an x-day crossover for the given stock based on a specific date range
The program also allows the user to buy and sell stocks- storing bought stocks in portfolios the
user is permitted to create and name. The user may also check the value of any created portfolio on
a specific date.
The user is shown an initial menu listing the stock selection, stock selling, and portfolio-related
features, which can be reopened. Upon selecting a stock, the user is shown another menu for the
stock-specific features described above, including buying a stock. The user is able to re-open this
menu, as well as return to the previous menu.
The user is permitted to quit the program from either menu.

NOTE: This program employs stock data from API AlphaVantage.

Thank you for using this program.
